### Pre-requisites
1. Primary knowledge of `git` and `npm`.
2. For Optional *OG-image* preview, primary knowledge of `puppeteer` is necessary.

# About `.env` variables
1. Environment specific variables are stored in `.env` files.
2. Rename `.env_demo` to `.env`.
3. Brief about the environment variables:
    - `PORT`
        - Application will be accessible on this PORT
        - A number from `8000` to `65535`.
    - `NODE_ENV`
        - Used to control the running - environment of the application.
        - Options : `development`, `staging` and `production`
        - For local development, keep it on `development`
   - `CHROMIUM_EXE_PATH` - `Optional`
       - Keep it empty, as this environment variable is automatically populated by `puppeteer`.
       - If you want to use a different browser, provide the complete path of the executable here.
    - `REVERSE_GEO_API_KEY`
        - Used by app, to get city details (name) from lat-lon from GPS location.
        - The city name and location (Lat-Lon) details are in-turn used to show weather-details.
        - Get API keys for Free at [here](https://apidocs.geoapify.com/docs/geocoding/reverse-geocoding/#about).
